# Car Price Analysis Regression Analysis
 
In recent years, the sale of pre-owned vehicles has emerged as a profitable industry in various global markets. Well-maintained used cars are gaining popularity, often rivaling new ones. The growing appeal of used cars is unsurprising given their affordability and flexibility for both buyers and sellers. 

In this project, my aim is to predict used car prices by leveraging attributes closely linked to pricing, such as production year, car model, mileage, engine size, airbags, and levies. To achieve this, we employ linear regression techniques. The process involves data preprocessing, including cleaning, followed by model selection and training. Ultimately, we create a linear regression model to predict used car prices, emphasizing accuracy as a key factor.
